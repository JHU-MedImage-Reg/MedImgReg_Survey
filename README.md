This official repository contains Python implementations of various image similarity measures, deformation regularization techniques, and evaluation methodologies for medical image registration.


## Image similarity measure:
1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
3. Pearson's correlation (PCC)
4. Local normalized cross-correlation (LNCC)
5. MIND
6. Mutual Information (MI)
7. Local mutual information (LMI)
8. Correlation Ratio (CR)

## Deformation regularization:
1. Diffusion regularization
2. Total-variation regularization
3. Bending energy
